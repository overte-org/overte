/**
 * @brief The global object in charge of setting up and controlling crash reporting.
 *
 * This object initializes and talks to crash reporting backends. For those, see
 * CrashHandlerBackend.h and the .cpp files that implement that interface.
 *
 * The crash URL and token can only be passed to the underlying system on start, so
 * things should be set up in such a way that startup is only done after those are set.
 *
 * start() will be automatically called when setEnabled() is called with true.
 * setAnnotation() can only be called after start.
 *
 *
 * To use, follow this general pattern in an application:
 *
 * @code {.cpp}
 * auto &ch = CrashHandler::getInstance();
 * ch.setPath(...);
 * ch.setUrl("https://server.com/crash-reports");
 * ch.setToken("1.2beta");
 * ch.setEnabled(true);
 * ch.setAnnotation("version", "1.3"); // Needs a started handler to work
 * @endcode
 *
 * For an assignment client, there are two potential ways to start, through the command-line
 * and through the settings system. Since the path, URL and token only apply on startup, the
 * code must be written such that if command arguments are not given, setEnabled() or start()
 * are not called until receiving the settings from the domain.
 *
