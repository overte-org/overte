/// @brief Provides a WebRTC signaling server that Interface clients can use to initiate WebRTC connections to the domain server
/// and its assignment clients.
/// 
/// @details The signaling server is expected to be hosted in the domain server. It provides a WebSocket for Interface clients
/// to use in the WebRTC signaling handshake process to establish WebRTC data channel connections to each of the domain server
/// and the assignment clients (i.e., separate WebRTC data channels for each but only a single signaling WebSocket). The
/// assignment client signaling messages are expected to be relayed - by the domain server - via Overte protocol messages on
/// the UDP connections between the domain server and assignment clients.
/// 
/// Additionally, for debugging purposes, instead of containing a WebRTC payload a signaling message may be an echo request.
/// This is bounced back to the client from the WebRTCSignalingServer if the domain server was the target, otherwise it is
/// expected to be bounced back upon receipt by the relevant assignment client.
///
/// The signaling messages are sent and received as JSON objects, with `to` and `from` fields in addition to either the WebRTC
/// signaling `data` payload or an `echo` request:
///
/// | Interface -> Server ||
/// | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
/// | `to`     | NodeType                                 |
/// | `from`   | WebSocket IP address & port, "n.n.n.n:n" |
/// | [`data`] | WebRTC signaling payload                 |
/// | [`echo`] | Echo request                             |
///
/// `*` The `from` field is filled in upon receipt by the WebRTCSignalingServer.
///
/// | Server -> Interface ||
/// | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
/// | `to`     | WebSocket IP address & port, "n.n.n.n:n" |
/// | `from`   | NodeType                                 |
/// | [`data`] | WebRTC signaling payload                 |
