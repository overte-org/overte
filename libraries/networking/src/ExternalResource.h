/**
 * Flexible management for external resources
 *
 * With the death of the original High Fidelity and the transition of the project to a community-managed
 * one, it became necessary to deal with that the various assets that used to be located under the
 * highfidelity.com domain, and there won't be a fixed place for them afterwards. Data
 * hosted by community members may not remain forever, reorganization may be necessary, people may want
 * to run mirrors, and some might want to run without external Internet access at all.
 *
 * This class makes it possible to deal with this in a more flexible manner: rather than hard-coding URLs
 * all over the codebase, now it's possible to easily change where all those things are downloaded from.
 *
 * The term 'bucket' refers to the buckets used on Amazon S3, but there's no requirement for S3 or anything
 * similar to be used. The term should just be taken as referring to the name of a data set.
