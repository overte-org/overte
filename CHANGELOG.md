### Fixes
- Fixed color conversion for glTF material colors (PR307)
- Fixed a possible crash in Mesh::map (PR392)
- Fixed multiple memory corruption issues that were causing frequent crashes (PR185)
	Most notably this gets rid of a frequent Create App related crash.
- Hide private methods and QObject signals from script engine (PR444)
- Fixed a regression that broke resetting the settings (PR445)
- Fixed deadlock on start on Debian Testing (PR185)
- Fixed Windows 11 showing up as Windows 10 in logs (PR448)

### Changes
- Replaced Vircadia Metaverse Server with a testing server as federation default (PR330)
- An empty audio device list now throws a warning instead of just a debug message (PR347)
- Increased the maximum log file size from 512 kiB to 10 MiB (PR342,PR513)

- Pressing the Return key with the the address/search bar in the Places App selected now navigates you to that address (PR403)
- Replaced QT Script with V8 scripting engine (PR185,PR507,PR519)
	This is a huge change under the hood, which ended up fixing a lot of issues.
	Since the new scripting engine does not behave exactly the same as the old one,
	some scripts might need fixing. The new scripting engine is especially picky when it comes to undefined behaviour.
	Most notably "use strict" is actually strict now and won't allow you to use variables without defining them first.
- Silenced ForceHtmlAudioOutputDeviceUpdate log message (PR473)
- Improved crash reporting functionality (PR480,PR484,PR518)
	Interface will ask if future crashes should be reported automatically when it detects that it crashed on last run.
	It will also ask once in case of a non-stable build.
- Changed the VR overlay to only recenter when moving (PR478)
- Added a workaround that prevents most users from needing to press down on the thumbstick to move (PR481,PR512)
