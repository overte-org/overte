# Build macOS

*Last Updated on December 1, 2021*

Please read the [general build guide](BUILD.md) for information on dependencies required for all platforms. This will include the necessary environment variables to customize your build. Only macOS specific instructions are found in this document.

## Prerequisites

### CMake, OpenSSL, and NPM

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is an excellent package manager for macOS. It makes the installation of some Overte dependencies very simple.

```bash
brew install cmake openssl npm
```

**Note:** You can also download alternative CMake versions from [Github](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases) if needed.

### Python 3

Download an install Python 3.6.6 or higher from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Execute the `Update Shell Profile.command` script that is provided with the installer.

### macOS SDK

You will need version `10.12` of the macOS SDK for building, otherwise you may experience crashing or other unintended issues due to the deprecation of OpenGL on macOS. You can get that SDK from [here](https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs). You must copy it in to your Xcode SDK directory, e.g.

```bash
cp -rp ~/Downloads/MacOSX10.12.sdk /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/
```

### OpenSSL

Assuming you've installed OpenSSL using the homebrew instructions above, you'll need to set `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` so CMake can find your installations.
For OpenSSL installed via homebrew, set `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` via `export OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl` or by appending `-DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl` to `cmake`.

## Generate and Build

You can choose to use either Unix Makefiles or Xcode.

### Xcode

You can ask CMake to generate Xcode project files instead of Unix Makefiles using the `-G Xcode` parameter after CMake. You will need to select the Xcode installation in the terminal first if you have not done so already.

```bash
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

cmake ../ -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.12.sdk" -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.12 -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl -G Xcode -DOSX_SDK=10.12  ..
```

After running CMake, you will have the make files or Xcode project file necessary to build all of the components. Open the `vircadia.xcodeproj` file, choose `ALL_BUILD` from the Product > Scheme menu (or target drop down), and click Run.

If the build completes successfully, you will have built targets for all components located in the `build/${target_name}/Debug` directories.

### make

Run CMake.

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.12.sdk" -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.12 -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl -DOSX_SDK=10.12  ..
```

You can append `-j4` to assign more threads to build with. The number indicates the number of threads, e.g. 4.

To package the installation, you can simply run `make package` afterwards.

## Architecture Support

If the build is intended to be packaged for distribution, the `VIRCADIA_CPU_ARCHITECTURE`
CMake variable needs to be set to an architecture specific value.

By default, it is set to `-march=native -mtune=native`, which yields builds optimized for a particular
machine, but these builds will not work on machines lacking same CPU instructions.

For packaging, it is recommended to set it to a different value, for example `-msse3`. This will help ensure that the build will run on all reasonably modern CPUs.

Setting `VIRCADIA_CPU_ARCHITECTURE` to an empty string will use the default compiler settings and yield
maximum compatibility.

## FAQ

1. **Problem:** Running the scheme `interface.app` from Xcode causes a crash for Interface related to `libgl`.
    1. **Cause:** The target `gl` generates a binary called `libgl`. A macOS `libGL.framework` item gets loaded instead by Xcode.
    2. **Solution:** In the Xcode target settings for `libgl`, set the version to `1.0.0`.
2. **Problem:** CMake complains about Python 3 being missing.
    1. **Cause:** CMake might be out of date.
    2. **Solution:** Try updating your CMake binary with command `brew upgrade cmake`, or by downloading and running a newer CMake installer, depending on how you originally installed CMake. Please keep in mind the recommended CMake versions noted above.
