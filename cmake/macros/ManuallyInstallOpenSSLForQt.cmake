macro(manually_install_openssl_for_qt)

  # Qt dynamically links OpenSSL if it can find it on the user's machine
  # We want to avoid it being found somewhere random and have it not being a compatible version
  # So even though we don't need the dynamic version of OpenSSL for our direct-use purposes
  # we use this macro to include the two SSL DLLs with the targets using QtNetwork
  if (WIN32)
    # we have to call find_package(OpenSSL) here even though this target may not directly need it
    find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)
