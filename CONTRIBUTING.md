Tips for Pull Requests 
===
To make the QA process go as smoothly as possible.

1. Have a basic description in your pull request. 
2. Write a basic test plan if you are altering or adding features.
3. If a new API is added, try to make sure that some level of basic documentation on how you can utilize it is included.
4. If an added API or feature requires an external service, try to document or link to instructions on how to create a basic working setup.
